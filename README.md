# Data-Visualization
My first data visualization. 

Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations/data

This data visualization will provide the following questions' answer. 

#1.Can you count something interesting?
#2.Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?
#3.Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
4.Can you compare two related quantities?
5.Can you make a scatterplot?
6.Can you make a time-series plot?

Having made these plots, what are some insights you get from them? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you would like to investigate further? What other questions do they lead you to ask?

By now youâ€™ve asked a bunch of questions, and found some neat insights. Is there an interesting narrative, a way of presenting the insights using text and plots from the above, that tells a compelling story? As you work out this story, what are some other trends/relationships you think will make it more complete?
